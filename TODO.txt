go through all files and check TODOs in them


fill out :
	init.sh		
		-create .chipmunk directory + index, prefs file
	prep_directory.sh
		-create tarball, hash, entry in index, tree file
	process_tarball.sh
		-split tarball, encode each into QR code. chuck in mp4 container
	upload.sh
		-upload vid to site, need api key

note: the function of these may be easier to carry out with python

then write reverse:
	download
	decode
	[recreate]
	
	!!check youtube compression doesnt ruin qr code, may have to use [imgur] or smth similar
make sure all #! match re python version
then write script to search databse

create_client_secrets script tells user what to do more
also do dependancys
+google-api-python-client - echo to user "library needed, instll it then retry"

then write utility that combines these all and calls them from a main func
